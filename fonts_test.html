	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a young Raspberry Pi, coding, electronics and robotics enthusiast, and I have a rare bone condition called MHE, or HME, which means I get chronic pain and fatigue. I want to help other people, especially kids, like me, to get into technology and free themselves from the burdens of living with any kind of physical or mental health problem or disability.</p>
	<p>
		I also run the Bridport Raspberry Jam with some friends. You can find our website here: 	<a href="https://bridportraspberryjam.wordpress.com">https://bridportraspberryjam.wordpress.com</a>
